# Customer Churn Analysis in Mobile Network Providers

This repository contains the group project for the module
**Business Intelligence and Data Mining (UFCFMM)**.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyse customer churn within mobile
network providers using business intelligence and data mining
techniques. The project investigates which customer characteristics
and service usage factors are most strongly associated with churn,
with the objective of identifying customers at high risk of leaving.

The insights produced by this analysis are intended to support
data-driven decision-making and inform targeted customer retention
strategies within the mobile telecommunications sector.
