## 1. Problem Definition and Data Scoping

### 1.1 Business Problem

Customer churn is a significant challenge for mobile network providers operating in highly competitive markets. Customers can switch providers easily due to number portability, similar pricing structures, and frequent promotional offers. As a result, losing customers directly impacts recurring revenue and customer lifetime value.

The business problem addressed in this project is:

**Which customer characteristics and service usage factors are most strongly associated with customer churn in mobile network providers, and how can this information be used to identify customers at high risk of leaving?**

This problem is well suited to a business intelligence and data mining approach, as historical customer data can be analysed to uncover patterns that distinguish customers who churn from those who remain.

### 1.2 Justification of Problem Choice

From a business perspective, reducing customer churn is strategically important because retaining existing customers is typically more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High churn rates can also indicate underlying issues such as poor service quality, unsuitable pricing structures, or ineffective customer engagement strategies.

By identifying the key drivers of churn, mobile network providers can make better-informed decisions regarding:
- Targeted retention campaigns  
- Pricing and contract design  
- Customer service prioritisation  

This makes customer churn analysis a realistic and valuable real-world business intelligence problem.

### 1.3 Dataset Selection and Justification

To address this problem, the project uses a publicly available telecommunications customer churn dataset, which contains customer-level data commonly collected by mobile network providers. The dataset includes customer demographics, contract details, service usage characteristics, billing information, and a binary churn indicator.

This dataset is appropriate for the analysis because:
- It reflects a realistic mobile telecommunications business context  
- It contains a clearly defined target variable (customer churn)  
- It includes a range of explanatory variables suitable for exploratory data analysis and classification techniques  
- It enables the investigation of relationships between customer behaviour and churn outcomes  

While the dataset is limited to a single industry and represents historical customer behaviour, it is sufficient for demonstrating how data mining techniques can be applied to support business decision-making in a mobile network environment.
